1.To compute all the roots of a quadratic equation by accepting the non-zero coefficients. 
Print appropriate messages.

2.(a)To simulates a Simple Calculator to perform the basic Arithmetic Operations
 (Consider the operators +, -, x, / and % using ‘switch’ statement)
  (b)To check whether a given alphebet is Vowel or Consonant using ‘switch’ statement.
  
3.To generate an electricity bill by accepting meter number of the consumer, number of units
consumed and print out the detail charges for the below scenario:
An electricity board charges the following rates for the use of electricity: 

	for the first 200 units 80 paise per unit

	for the next 100 units 90 paise per unit 

	beyond 300 units Rs 1 per unit 

All users are charged a minimum of Rs. 100 as meter charge. If the total amount is more than Rs. 400, 
then an additional surcharge of 15% of total amount is charged.

4.To find the sum of individual digits of a positive integer number reducing into single digit.

5.To generate and print the first ‘N’ Fibonacci numbers such that Fn = F(n-1) + F(n-2) where n>2.
A Fibonacci sequence is defined as “the first and second terms in the sequence are 0 and 1. 
Subsequent terms are found by adding the preceding two terms in the sequence”.

6.To generate and print all the prime numbers between range N1 and N2, where ‘N1’ and ‘N2’ are value supplied by the user.

7.To find the value of cos(x) using the series, 1 - x2/2! + x4/4! - x6/6! + x8/8! - ... up to 
N terms accuracy (With and without using in-built function)

8.To reverse a given four-digit integer number and check whether it is a palindrome or not. 
Output the given number with suitable message.

9.To input N integer numbers into a single dimension array, sort them in to 
ascending order using BUBBLE SORT technique, and then to print both the given array 
and the sorted array with suitable headings.

10.To input N integer numbers in ascending order into a single dimension array, and 
then to perform BINARY SEARCH for a given Key integer number and report success or failure in the form of a suitable message.

11.To perform addition and subtraction of two matrices after checking their 
compatibility and print both input & output matrices with suitable headings. 

12.To find the trace and norm of a given matrix A (M x N) by checking the 
compatibility and print both input & output matrices with suitable headings. 
Use user-defined functions to find their trace and norm.
